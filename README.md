# OreBabelfish

This mod automatically converts items on harvest and on player pickup according to a dictionary. This also works with the BuildCraft quarry.

A default dictionary (orebabelfish.cfg) is generated on first startup:
```
oreGold     minecraft:gold_ore     0
oreIron     minecraft:iron_ore     0
oreLapis    minecraft:lapis_ore    0
oreDiamond  minecraft:diamond_ore  0
oreRedstone minecraft:redstone_ore 0
oreEmerald  minecraft:emerald_ore  0
oreQuartz   minecraft:quartz_ore   0
oreCoal     minecraft:coal_ore     0
```
The first column is the dictionary name of the items that should be converted, the second column is the target item ID and the third column is the target data value.
